# Drowsiness Alert System

## Description
A Python-based computer vision project that detects drowsiness using facial landmarks.

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV, dlib, and other libraries to create a real-time drowsiness alert system. It analyzes facial landmarks to determine if the eyes are closed. If the eyes are closed, the user will be alerted.

## Features
- Real-time facial landmark detection.
- Eyes closed detection using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) formula.
- Drowsiness alert with visual and auditory feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    cd drowsiness-alert
    ```

2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Feel free to test the drowsiness alert system.
